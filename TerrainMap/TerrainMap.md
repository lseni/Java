# Terrain Map -> Topographic
##################################
You are given a two-dimensional array of values that give the height of a terrian at different points in a square.
Write a constructor "public Terrian(double[][] heights)" and a method "public void printFloodMap(double waterLevel)" 
that prints out a flood map, showing which of the points in the terrian would be flooded if the water level was the given value. 
In the flood map, print a * for each flooded point and a space for each point that is not flooded. 
Then write a program that reads one hundred terrian height values and shows how the terrian gets flooded 
when the water level increases in ten steps from the lowest point in the terrian to the highest.
